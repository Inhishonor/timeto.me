# How to Use the App

Hi!

Developer is here üë®‚Äçüíª

I built this app to manage my productivity. Here I will show how I use it.

It is a pragmatic guide. I mean, it is NOT just a list of features, but my real day-to-day experience.

I will start with the most important things: timer, repeating tasks and checklists. That is 90% I use. Then others like tasks, calendar, goals, shortcuts, etc.

Enjoy!

# Timer

You must set a timer for each activity, like eating, working, reading, etc.

**There is NO "stop" option! Once you complete one activity, you must set the timer for the next one, even if it is a "sleeping" activity.**

In other words, to finish the current activity, you have to start the next one.

This way provides real 24/7 data on how long everything takes. It will look like this:

</p>

By default, the app has some activities, but you can add your own. Here are mine:

</p>

You may think choosing activity and timer for each task is overwhelming. This is where "Repeating Tasks" come into play.

# Repeating Tasks

I will show how it works for me.

Almost all of my activities are actually repeated. I wake up at the same time, then I spend 1 hour getting ready, 2 hours working, 1 hour eating, and so on.

In the app, I created a repeating task for each activity with a time of day. It looks like this:

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appstome/timetome-app/main/android_app/src/main/res/drawable/readme_repeatings_1.jpg" width="200" />
</p>

Pay attention to 3 things:
- Time of day, like "Every day at 9:00";
- Emoji, like "ü•ó", which means the "Eating" activity;
- Timer, like "1h".

These repeating tasks are added to my task list every day. It looks like this:

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appstome/timetome-app/main/android_app/src/main/res/drawable/readme_repeatings_2.jpg" width="200" />
</p>

Note, the tasks are sorted by time of day and indicate how much time is left. It's like a schedule.

**But most importantly, when I press it, it automatically starts a timer with the right activity.**

Of course, you can create not only everyday tasks. For example, watering a cactus once a week or paying for internet once a month, etc.

I believe this is the main feature of the app. I recommend using it to the max.

# Checklists

**The most important is HOW checklists work WITH repeating tasks.**

In fact, checklists are an addition to repeating tasks.

You can add a checklist for any repeating task and it will always appear below the timer.

Here are examples for morning routine, work and evening:

# Conclusion

We learned the timer, repeating tasks, and checklists. Here are the most important points:

- Timer is running all the time;
- Using repeating tasks to the max;
- Timer, activity and checklist will be set automatically.
